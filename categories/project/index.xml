      <description>Context My Downloads folder is a mess!
I have got hundreds of files in that directory. Most of them are PDF documents with some images, archives and disk images.
&amp;ldquo;Is there a way to only list all the PDF files present in a directory?&amp;rdquo;
Well, filtering based on file extension (.pdf) should be able to do this for me. Moreover, I can leverage the power of regular expression: $ ls -lh ~/Downloads/*.</description>

      <description>I built my first-ever mobile application as a weekend project.
This post describes my experience, thoughts and emotions over the past few days.
Motivation Last week, my friends introduced me to a cards game called &amp;ldquo;350&amp;rdquo;. It involved bidding points, calling trumps, playing hands - so much fun! Now the only issue was that there was no simple way to store our points table. We found ourselves repeatedly checking the scores and wasting a lot of time talking about game information.</description>
