      <description>There are a lot of good resources about using context packages in software based on your programming language. However, I found that most of these do not address the basic questions of motivation behind the need of context: - How does the use of context help us in programming? - When should a programmer use context?
In this blog post, I will share what I understand about context.
Motivation Consider you are an event manager of a restaurant.</description>

      <title>Typing in Python, Go and JavaScript</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: This post has been written from the point-of-view of a software developer rather than a theoretical computer science. So I &amp;ldquo;ask for forgiveness&amp;rdquo; if the post seems too colloquial and pragmatic.
 Reading through the articles on programming languages, you are bound to stumble upon statements similar to the following: 1. &amp;ldquo;Python is a strongly typed, dynamic language.&amp;rdquo; 2. &amp;ldquo;Go is a statically typed, strong language.&amp;rdquo; 3. &amp;ldquo;JavaScript is a dynamic language which is weakly typed.</description>

      <title>Duck Typing in Python</title>

      <description>What is Duck Typing? Python is a dynamic language which is strongly typed. Dynamic binding is the capability to use an instance without regard for its type. It is handled entirely through a simple attribute lookup process. Whenever an attribute is accessed as object.attribute: 1. attribute is located by searching within the instance itself. This yields a positive result when the attribute being searched for is an instance variable or method.</description>

      <description>This past week I read about Python&amp;rsquo;s iterator protocol and how the philosophy of iteration is deeply embedded into the language design. Many features that I love about Python such as list comprehensions, tuple unpacking leverage the power of iterator protocol. I wrote an article on Medium explaining how developers can implement it and use these features much more efficiently in their day-to-day life.</description>
