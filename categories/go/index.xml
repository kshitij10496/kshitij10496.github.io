      <description>There are a lot of good resources about using context packages in software based on your programming language. However, I found that most of these do not address the basic questions of motivation behind the need of context: - How does the use of context help us in programming? - When should a programmer use context?
In this blog post, I will share what I understand about context.

      <description>Disclaimer: This post has been written from the point-of-view of a software developer rather than a theoretical computer science. So I &amp;ldquo;ask for forgiveness&amp;rdquo; if the post seems too colloquial and pragmatic.
 Reading through the articles on programming languages, you are bound to stumble upon statements similar to the following: 1. &amp;ldquo;Python is a strongly typed, dynamic language.&amp;rdquo; 2. &amp;ldquo;Go is a statically typed, strong language.&amp;rdquo; 3. &amp;ldquo;JavaScript is a dynamic language which is weakly typed.</description>
