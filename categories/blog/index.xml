      <description>tl;dr: post about posting more posts
I have forgotten to write blog posts for over a year or have I?
Blogging 101 I started this blog after I was selected as a GSoC 2016 student under SymPy so as to log my progress. Few weeks working into the program, it seemed that I had developed the habit of writing weekly articles. Back then, I intended to continue maintaining my blog.</description>

      <description>Looking to create your personal blog using Hugo and hosting it on GitHub Pages?
To be honest, it can sound a bit intimidating and challenging at first.
I, too, felt the same while I setup this blog using Hugo and the Coder theme.
In this post, I share my experience during the process - from the specific commands to the lessons learnt.
In addition to this, I also share my workflow for publishing posts using a shell script.</description>
