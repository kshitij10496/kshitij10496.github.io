      <description>I built my first-ever mobile application as a weekend project.
This post describes my experience, thoughts and emotions over the past few days.
Motivation Last week, my friends introduced me to a cards game called &amp;ldquo;350&amp;rdquo;. It involved bidding points, calling trumps, playing hands - so much fun! Now the only issue was that there was no simple way to store our points table. We found ourselves repeatedly checking the scores and wasting a lot of time talking about game information.</description>
