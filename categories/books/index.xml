      <description>Heading into 2019, I aim to read a lot of books across genres - from historical fictions to the latest genetics developments, from philosophy about human societies to the realities of individual emotions.
Over the weekend, I updated my Goodreads shelves and downloaded a lot of &amp;ldquo;Samples&amp;rdquo; on my Kindle from the Amazon Store. My intention is to read these preview chapters at random on my Kindle and dive into only those books which interest me.</description>
