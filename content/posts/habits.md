# Chapter 04: Keystone Habits
- Keystone habits – the habits that matter the most are the ones that when they start to shift and remake other patterns.
- They start a process that transform everything over time.
- Success doesn't depend on getting every single thing right; but instead it relies on identifying a few key priorities and fashioning them into powerful levers.
- They offer "small wins"
    - Small wins are a steady application of a small advantage.
    - Once a small win had been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win.
    - Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.
- They help other habits to flourish by creating new structures, and they establish cultures where change becomes contagious.
- They create cultures where new values become ingrained.
- They make tough choices easier.
- They transform us by creating cultures that make clear the values that in the heat of a difficult decision or a moment of uncertainty, we might otherwise forget.

## Grit
- the tendency to work strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over years despite failures, adversity and plateaus in progress
- it grows out of a culture
# TODOs
- Draft a list of everything you want to accomplish during your lifetime.
# Advice
- You can't *order* people to change; that's not how the brain works.
- Individuals have habits; groups have routines.
- The best agencies understand the importance of routines. The worst are headed by people who never thought about it and wonder why no one followed their oders.
- Develop a capacity for obsessiveness; all elite performers are obsessives.
- Winning is a natural extension
- Not sharing an opportunity to learn is a cardinal sin.
- Cultures grow out of the keystone habits in every organization, whether leaders are aware of them or not.
