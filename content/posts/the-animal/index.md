The Mind-Body Problem is a debate in the Philosophy of Mind concerned with our human mind and its relationship with our bodies. There are two competing schools of thought - **Dualism**, and **Monoism** - approaching this topic from different perspectives. Dualism proclaims that the human mind and the human body are two independent entities, while Monoism posits that both are imperceptibly indiscernible.

No matter your beliefs, it is important to stay connected with your body - The Animal. It might be useful to check in with the body regularly and listen to its feedback. This thought is more pronounced now more than ever as human society has been tackling another Creation.

We need to put thought into how the body feels every day, possibly during every activity. It is important to balance the desire for growth (or consumption) while not becoming indifferent to The Animal. In order to do so, it is imperative to have expectations matching the demands of the body and its physical limits.

The Animal remembers every bad thing done to it. Whether it is staring continuously at a screen for work, or not moving enough, or running even when the joints complain, it is all going to add up in time. The bill always comes true.

Lately, I have been actively mindful of these three things about my body:

- Proper nutrition
- Adequate exercise
- Time for recovery

Donâ€™t be cruel to Animals. Start small.
