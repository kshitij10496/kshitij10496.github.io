In creative spheres, the habit of **building** and **shipping** work is a vital feature of high-performing individuals. As a software-focused engineer, I think it’s important to have something to show for at the end of the week. It could be a new product feature at work, reaching a milestone in a personal hobby, or whatever it is you are actively spending your time on.

Shipping something regularly has the indirect benefit of being an intrinsic motivator for breaking into a positive, self-reinforcing loop. A loop of performance and throughput. Just like a muscle that builds up through training consistently. For example, this newsletter is a motivation for me to sit down and clarify my thoughts.

Also, working on bigger projects has taught me the value of milestones as an indicator of gradual progress. Without an indication of progress in your endeavors, it might get difficult to follow through after a certain threshold. Milestones provide feedback and mental checkpoints for course correction.

How exactly should we go about developing this habit of shipping results?
The linked post has got a few good pieces of advice for building a career from consistently delivering results.

At the end of the day, it’s the ability of creation that provides a lot of fulfillment, at least to me.
