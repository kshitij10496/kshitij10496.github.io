Ref: [TIL: 8 versions of UUID and when to use them](https://ntietz.com/blog/til-uses-for-the-different-uuid-versions/)

Handy reference for when to use the different versions of UUIDs.

For DB primary keys, random strings are inefficient for lookups i.e. UUID v4.
I will give the v8 with prefix a try for my next project.
