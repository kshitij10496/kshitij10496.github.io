Most of the books I found meaningful are products of translation.

Real-time translation of diplomatic speeches at such a grand stage as the UN has far more stakes.
While watching speeches in the Indian Houses of Parliaments, I observe similar phenomenon.
It makes me wonder how effectively can such powerful people communicate with each other using different tongues.

Distilling a person's ideas from their words into an essence.
Repackaging that essense using a different set of words, and figures of speech.

The act of translation lacks a layer of agency, at least on the surface.
After all, it's not the translator's original idea that they are communicate, is it?

Interpretation seems to be a unifying skill, to me at least.
Unfortunately, I have not translated any piece of work yet.
But, it could be a potentially valuable exercise.
