#### [Why I Maintain a 17 Year Old Thinkpad][2]

In general, I find physical artifacts to be almost always fragile to the effects of time (including plastic). Thus, I don't feel comfortable about discussing the notion of anti-fragility in the context of laptops. However, the argument to differentiate between Thinkpads and Macbooks in terms of longevity, and repairability is appealing. Especially considering that I have never owned a Thinkpad, and recently bought a couple of new Macbooks.

#### [Sorting Go Slices][1]

This article makes a strong case for using the "generic" implementation (provided by the `slices` package) for sorting slices in Go.
I have used the `sort.Interface` interface as well as the `sort.Slice` function to sort slices. For precisely the same reasons listed in the post, I have never felt comfortable with either of them. The next time I need to sort a slice, I will make sure to give the `slices.Sort` function a try.
