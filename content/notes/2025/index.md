### October 6

#### [The Runner's Routine | YouTube][8]

Beautiful, motivating video yet again from Tracksmith.

### August 24

#### [The Only Video You Need to Get Started with Neovim][7]

Every time I watch TJ explain the config, either I learn something new or refine existing knowledge about my Neovim setup - new keymaps, LSP config that I can play with.

### August 23

#### [The ROI of exercise | Herman Martinus][6]

The argument to focus on *Quality of life-years* instead of *Quantity of life-years* is compelling.
A part of me related to the ability of focused hard work translating into sustainable energy into other aspects of our life.

### July 24

#### [Agentic Engineering | Zed][4]

This series by Zed Industries is worth following.
I really enjoyed the [episode with Mitchell Hashimoto][5] about his appraoch to using AI Agents while developing software systems. Key takeways include:
- Thinking more like an architect.
- Allow AI Agents to use tools to achieve the desired outcome.
- Comment what the code implementation as a way to build redundancy (AI can flag any discrepancies now)

And I look forward to Steve Yegge's episode next.

### May 24

#### [Find Your People - Jessica Livingston][3]

Find what problems people are working on, and filter what aligns with you.
This is how you find your people.
Do not just drift, start steering your life.

### April 3

#### [Why I Maintain a 17 Year Old Thinkpad][2]

In general, I find physical artifacts to be almost always fragile to the effects of time (including plastic). Thus, I don't feel comfortable about discussing the notion of anti-fragility in the context of laptops. However, the argument to differentiate between Thinkpads and Macbooks in terms of longevity, and repairability is appealing. Especially considering that I have never owned a Thinkpad, and recently bought a couple of new Macbooks.

### March 25

#### [Sorting Go Slices][1]

This article makes a strong case for using the "generic" implementation (provided by the `slices` package) for sorting slices in Go.
I have used the `sort.Interface` interface as well as the `sort.Slice` function to sort slices. For precisely the same reasons listed in the post, I have never felt comfortable with either of them. The next time I need to sort a slice, I will make sure to give the `slices.Sort` function a try.
