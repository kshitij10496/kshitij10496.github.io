      <description>Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
451F: Temperature at which book-paper catches fire and burns.
Enter a dystopia where firemen are responsible for burning books rather than preventing houses from fires - in both cases, the firemen are the custodians of peace, saving people from potential &amp;ldquo;dangers&amp;rdquo;.
Recommended for: Anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t read regularly.
Characters:
 Guy Montag Clarrise McClellan Mildred Captain Beatty Faber  This is a story of Montag, a fireman, awakening to the reality of world he is living in (similar to that of Winston in 1984).</description>

      <description>Heading into 2019, I aim to read a lot of books across genres - from historical fictions to the latest genetics developments, from philosophy about human societies to the realities of individual emotions.
Over the weekend, I updated my Goodreads shelves and downloaded a lot of &amp;ldquo;Samples&amp;rdquo; on my Kindle from the Amazon Store. My intention is to read these preview chapters at random on my Kindle and dive into only those books which interest me.</description>
