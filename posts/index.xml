      <title>Why I Write Go</title>

      <description>tl;dr: This is not a rant about how Go is &amp;ldquo;superior&amp;rdquo; to other languages. It&amp;rsquo;s all apples and oranges and I like them both, not at the same time, ofcourse! üçé/üçä
off-topic: When I was a little boy üë¶, I used to play all day long with my legos - constructing buildings, trucks, everything that I could imagine. Chaining dominoes with my parent&amp;rsquo;s music collection cassettes, solving jigsaw puzzles and playing scrabble with my cousins.</description>

      <description>tl;dr: post about posting more posts
I have forgotten to write blog posts for over a year or have I?
Blogging 101 I started this blog after I was selected as a GSoC 2016 student under SymPy so as to log my progress. Few weeks working into the program, it seemed that I had developed the habit of writing weekly articles. Back then, I intended to continue maintaining my blog.</description>

      <description>Looking to create your personal blog using Hugo and hosting it on GitHub Pages?
To be honest, it can sound a bit intimidating and challenging at first.
I, too, felt the same while I setup this blog using Hugo and the Coder theme.
In this post, I share my experience during the process - from the specific commands to the lessons learnt.
In addition to this, I also share my workflow for publishing posts using a shell script.</description>

      <title>For some Context</title>

      <description>There are a lot of good resources about using context packages in software based on your programming language. However, I found that most of these do not address the basic questions of motivation behind the need of context: - How does the use of context help us in programming? - When should a programmer use context?
In this blog post, I will share what I understand about context.
Motivation Consider you are an event manager of a restaurant.</description>

      <title>Typing in Python, Go and JavaScript</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: This post has been written from the point-of-view of a software developer rather than a theoretical computer science. So I &amp;ldquo;ask for forgiveness&amp;rdquo; if the post seems too colloquial and pragmatic.
 Reading through the articles on programming languages, you are bound to stumble upon statements similar to the following: 1. &amp;ldquo;Python is a strongly typed, dynamic language.&amp;rdquo; 2. &amp;ldquo;Go is a statically typed, strong language.&amp;rdquo; 3. &amp;ldquo;JavaScript is a dynamic language which is weakly typed.</description>

      <title>Duck Typing in Python</title>

      <guid>https://kshitij10496.github.io/posts/duck-typing-in-python/</guid>
      <description>What is Duck Typing? Python is a dynamic language which is strongly typed. Dynamic binding is the capability to use an instance without regard for its type. It is handled entirely through a simple attribute lookup process. Whenever an attribute is accessed as object.attribute: 1. attribute is located by searching within the instance itself. This yields a positive result when the attribute being searched for is an instance variable or method.</description>

      <description>This past week I read about Python&amp;rsquo;s iterator protocol and how the philosophy of iteration is deeply embedded into the language design. Many features that I love about Python such as list comprehensions, tuple unpacking leverage the power of iterator protocol. I wrote an article on Medium explaining how developers can implement it and use these features much more efficiently in their day-to-day life.</description>

      <description>FiniteSet | list
ImageSet, | list (if `f` is periodic) Union | EmptySet | empty list Others | None  Adding domain support.
I added a domain argument to isolve whose default value is the real domain (domain=S.Reals). A few limitation to the conditions of S.Infinity and S.NegativeInfinity followed.
Another noticable point, from the point of implementation, was to deal with singularities and discontinuities of the given inequality. For this, I used the continuous_domain method to find the continuous domains of the expression within the specified domain.</description>

      <title>GSoC Week 09 - The One with Inequalities</title>

      <description>This week I worked on solving trigonometric inequalities.
Trigonometric inequalities The primary univariate inequality solver - solve_univariate_inequality,
depends upon the results of solve in order to solve the given inequality. Taking a cue from PR#10022 on incorporating solveset for inequalities, I worked on developing an approach for replacing the use of solve with solveset in solving inequalities.
Idea
 Convert Set-type output from solveset to list objects similar to that returned by solve.</description>

      <description>This week I updated my PR#11277 to find the period of a general function.
Periodicity In the past few weeks, I dedicated a lot of my time reading about the property of periodicity of a function. Earlier, I had implemented a trivial(and restricted) functionality for this task. This motivated me to study this topic as I planned to generalise the function.
Here are my notes on periodicity which were the literature reference for the development of the method:</description>

      <description>This week I worked on the topic of singularities.
Singularities  A singularity is in general a point at which a given mathematical object is not defined.
 Examples:
 1/x has a singularity at x = 0 as it seems to reach infinity. |x| (Absolute) has a singularity at x = 0 since it is not differentiable at that point. ‚àöx (Square root) has a singularity at x = 0 since it doesnot admit a tangent there.</description>

      <description>Hi folks !
The past couple of weeks were spent of developing heuristics for determining the fundamental period of a given trigonometric function.
In our higher school, we all must have come across Trigonometric Functions. One of the most striking properties of these functions is their periodicty.
The ability of a function to repeat its values in regular intervals has always caught my imagination.
Motivation Well, SymPy ought to have a functionality to determine the period of a function.</description>

      <description>Hey !
This week I worked on implementing a method for finding the range of a function in a given domain. Following from last weeek&amp;rsquo;s research on the same, I tried to develop these utility functions.
Implementation Here, I have defined the two functions along with some of their implementation details:
continuous_in(f, x, interval)
The function returns the sub-domains as an Union of Interval in case a discontinuity exists in the interval.</description>

      <description>This week I worked on developing methods for computing the range of an univariate function. For this pupose, I spent most of my time in research; reading previous discussions on mailing lists, pull requests and wikis.
Progress Suppose, we want to solve the following equation in the variable x:
sin(x) = œÄ / 2
We can straight away state that this equations has no solutions as the range of the function sin is -1 to 1</description>

      <description>$ git log PR #11149 : Intersection of null Range and an Interval returns EmptySet
PR #11164 : Intersection of certain ImageSets with Intervals
In the next week, I will try to design a method to determine the range of a function in the given domain.
This will require some digging up and a bit of research.
Looking forward to it !</description>

      <description>A robust framework for solving equations is a salient feature of any Computer Algebra System. An important idea in this regard is &amp;ldquo;Rewriting and Decomposition&amp;rdquo;. By using this techniques, we try to reduce the given equation to a set of simpler equations which can be solved with relative ease.
An example here would be the best way to establish the significance of the above idea.
If we have to solve for x in the equation f(x) = 0, where</description>

      <title>Auditing SymPy&#39;s Transcendental solver</title>

      <description>Having considered the current codebase of _tsolve function, I find the following few points considered while implementing the new solver:
 modularise the code for various classes of equations(LambertW, bivariate equation type, logarithmic, exponential).
 using SymPy Set objects internally, instead of using the built-in Python lists.
 use of decompogen function to check for possible decomposition of the given expression into simpler functions. handle the case where the given equation has no closed-form solution and infinite recursion occurs.</description>
