      <description>tl;dr: This is not a rant about how Go is &amp;ldquo;superior&amp;rdquo; to other languages. It&amp;rsquo;s all apples and oranges and I like them both, not at the same time, ofcourse! 🍎/🍊
off-topic: When I was a little boy 👦, I used to play all day long with my legos - constructing buildings, trucks, everything that I could imagine. Chaining dominoes with my parent&amp;rsquo;s music collection cassettes, solving jigsaw puzzles and playing scrabble with my cousins.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of good resources about using context packages in software based on your programming language. However, I found that most of these do not address the basic questions of motivation behind the need of context:
How does the use of context help us in programming? When should a programmer use context? In this blog post, I will share what I understand about context.
Motivation Consider you are an event manager of a restaurant.</description>

      <title>Typing in Python, Go and JavaScript</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: This post has been written from the point-of-view of a software developer rather than a theoretical computer science. So I &amp;ldquo;ask for forgiveness&amp;rdquo; if the post seems too colloquial and pragmatic.
Reading through the articles on programming languages, you are bound to stumble upon statements similar to the following:
&amp;ldquo;Python is a strongly typed, dynamic language.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Go is a statically typed, strong language.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;JavaScript is a dynamic language which is weakly typed.</description>
