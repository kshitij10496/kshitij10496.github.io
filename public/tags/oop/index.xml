      <description>What is Duck Typing?    Python is a dynamic language which is strongly typed. Dynamic binding is the capability to use an instance without regard for its type. It is handled entirely through a simple attribute lookup process. Whenever an attribute is accessed as object.attribute:
 attribute is located by searching within the instance itself. This yields a positive result when the attribute being searched for is an instance variable or method.</description>
