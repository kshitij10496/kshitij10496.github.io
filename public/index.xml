      <description>Extremely engaging, fun pop &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; fiction.
Thoughts Provoked     The difference between &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;engineering&amp;rdquo;. Without robust engineering skills at hand, scientific knowledge might not become a differentiating factor. An individual&amp;rsquo;s character is revealed only during an adversity. Most seemingly strong people can be cowards.  There is nothing philosophical, in particular, throughout the storyline. However, a bunch of facts related to basic science are tied into the narrative; no rocket science.</description>

      <description>Context    My Downloads folder is a mess!
I have got hundreds of files in that directory. Most of them are PDF documents with some images, archives and disk images.
“Is there a way to only list all the PDF files present in a directory?”
Well, filtering based on file extension (.pdf) should be able to do this for me. Moreover, I can leverage the power of regular expression: $ ls -lh ~/Downloads/*.</description>

      <description>I built my first-ever mobile application as a weekend project.
This post describes my experience, thoughts and emotions over the past few days.
 Motivation    Last week, my friends introduced me to a cards game called “350”. It involved bidding points, calling trumps, playing hands - so much fun! Now the only issue was that there was no simple way to store our points table. We found ourselves repeatedly checking the scores and wasting a lot of time talking about game information.</description>

      <description>Lately, I have been experimenting with running PostgreSQL in a Docker container and communicating with it - from an application. This article documents my experience, learnings and methodology.
Problem    I have got a lot of small personal projects which use separate databases.
Each DB is associated with a unique configuration (combination of user, password, name) which as exported as environment variables in the relevant applications.
Now, this soon got messy as my machine was polluted with lots of DBs and their configurations.</description>

Let’s talk about the asymmetries in our lives today.
After reading Fooled By Randomness and The Black Swan from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, I am convinced by the presence and importance of asymmetries in all walks of our lives. Moreover, these asymmetries are almost always associated with a “rare”(low probability), “unforeseeable”, highly consequential event (called a Black Swan).
Turning a blind eye to them can result in a massive blowup – the much fraught unbecoming.</description>

Let’s talk about education today.
There are 2 complementary aspects of getting an education:
 the scholarly education obtained from rigorously studying academic texts obtained from schooling. the practical education learned from life experiences dealing in the real world.  I’m sure that most of us would agree that they fall somewhere on this spectrum of the wise and academic to the streetwise and practical.</description>

      <description>It was not about being the &amp;ldquo;bigger man&amp;rdquo;. Essentially it was about becoming a principled, disciplined person. I think it&amp;rsquo;s totally normal for us to feel angry at some point. It&amp;rsquo;s not about teleology - estiology: answer what could this experience mean? From now onwards, whenever I find myself getting frustrated at a person/thing, I delude myself to think of a happy memory associated with it. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty hack I&amp;rsquo;ve been using lately.</description>

      <description>Looking to create your personal blog using Hugo and hosting it on GitHub Pages?
To be honest, it can sound a bit intimidating and challenging at first.
I, too, felt the same while I setup this blog using Hugo and the Coder theme.
In this post, I share my experience during the process - from the specific commands to the lessons learnt.
In addition to this, I also share my workflow for publishing posts using a shell script.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of good resources about using context packages in software based on your programming language. However, I found that most of these do not address the basic questions of motivation behind the need of context:
 How does the use of context help us in programming? When should a programmer use context?  In this blog post, I will share what I understand about context.
Motivation    Consider you are an event manager of a restaurant.</description>

 Reading through the articles on programming languages, you are bound to stumble upon statements similar to the following:
 &amp;ldquo;Python is a strongly typed, dynamic language.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Go is a statically typed, strong language.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;JavaScript is a dynamic language which is weakly typed.</description>

      <description>What is Duck Typing?    Python is a dynamic language which is strongly typed. Dynamic binding is the capability to use an instance without regard for its type. It is handled entirely through a simple attribute lookup process. Whenever an attribute is accessed as object.attribute:
 attribute is located by searching within the instance itself. This yields a positive result when the attribute being searched for is an instance variable or method.</description>

      <description>This past week I read about Python&amp;rsquo;s iterator protocol and how the philosophy of iteration is deeply embedded into the language design. Many features that I love about Python such as list comprehensions, tuple unpacking leverage the power of iterator protocol. I wrote an article on Medium explaining how developers can implement it and use these features much more efficiently in their day-to-day life.</description>

I added a domain argument to isolve whose default value is the real domain (domain=S.Reals). A few limitation to the conditions of S.Infinity and S.NegativeInfinity followed.
Another noticable point, from the point of implementation, was to deal with singularities and discontinuities of the given inequality.</description>

      <description>This week I worked on solving trigonometric inequalities.
Trigonometric inequalities    The primary univariate inequality solver - solve_univariate_inequality,
depends upon the results of solve in order to solve the given inequality. Taking a cue from PR#10022 on incorporating solveset for inequalities, I worked on developing an approach for replacing the use of solve with solveset in solving inequalities.
Idea
 Convert Set-type output from solveset to list objects similar to that returned by solve.</description>

Periodicity    In the past few weeks, I dedicated a lot of my time reading about the property of periodicity of a function. Earlier, I had implemented a trivial(and restricted) functionality for this task. This motivated me to study this topic as I planned to generalise the function.
Here are my notes on periodicity which were the literature reference for the development of the method:</description>

      <description>This week I worked on the topic of singularities.
Singularities     A singularity is in general a point at which a given mathematical object is not defined.
 Examples:
 1/x has a singularity at x = 0 as it seems to reach infinity. |x| (Absolute) has a singularity at x = 0 since it is not differentiable at that point. √x (Square root) has a singularity at x = 0 since it doesnot admit a tangent there.</description>

      <description>Hi folks !
The past couple of weeks were spent of developing heuristics for determining the fundamental period of a given trigonometric function.
In our higher school, we all must have come across Trigonometric Functions. One of the most striking properties of these functions is their periodicty.
The ability of a function to repeat its values in regular intervals has always caught my imagination.
Motivation    Well, SymPy ought to have a functionality to determine the period of a function.</description>

      <description>Hey !
This week I worked on implementing a method for finding the range of a function in a given domain. Following from last weeek&amp;rsquo;s research on the same, I tried to develop these utility functions.
Implementation    Here, I have defined the two functions along with some of their implementation details:
continuous_in(f, x, interval)
The function returns the sub-domains as an Union of Interval in case a discontinuity exists in the interval.</description>

This will require some digging up and a bit of research.

      <description>A robust framework for solving equations is a salient feature of any Computer Algebra System. An important idea in this regard is &amp;ldquo;Rewriting and Decomposition&amp;rdquo;. By using this techniques, we try to reduce the given equation to a set of simpler equations which can be solved with relative ease.
An example here would be the best way to establish the significance of the above idea.

      <description>Having considered the current codebase of _tsolve function, I find the following few points considered while implementing the new solver:
 modularise the code for various classes of equations(LambertW, bivariate equation type, logarithmic, exponential). using SymPy Set objects internally, instead of using the built-in Python lists. use of decompogen function to check for possible decomposition of the given expression into simpler functions. handle the case where the given equation has no closed-form solution and infinite recursion occurs.</description>
